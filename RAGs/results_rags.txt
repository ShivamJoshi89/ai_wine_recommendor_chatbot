Expert Advice from Sommeliers:
‚Ä¢ mushrooms     and     the     wine    are     compatible.     In      general,        I       prefer  chanterelles    with
slightly         off-dry         white   wines,  such    as      dry     German,         Alsatian,       or      Austrian
Rieslings.      Morels  are     usually better  when    paired  with    creamier        and     milder  meats

‚Ä¢ DISH:
Risotto with    mushrooms       or      truffles,
        or      any
game
        like    quail.
3.      Vietti  Barbera d‚ÄôAlba.
This    wine    is      elegant with    good    acidity and     drinks  so      well.
DISH:   This    wine    would   go      with    almost  anything.       If      I       had     to      choose  a       dish,   it
would   have    to      be
rabbit.
4.      Litina  Cascina Castlet.
DISH:   This    is      another wine    that    is      a       fabulous        food    wine    and     goes    with    almost
anything.       I‚Äôd     have
pasta   with    a       nice    ragu    sauce.
5.      Maria   Borio   Barbera d‚ÄôAsti.
DISH:   This    is      a       light   red     and     would   go      well    with
tuna.

‚Ä¢ create        a       platform        for     wine    to      show    well.   Mushrooms       are     spectacular     with    red
wines   with    an      earthy  aroma,  or      white   wines   with    some    age.
‚ÄîTIM    KOPEC,  wine    director,       Veritas (NYC)
Pinot   Noir    and     mushrooms       are     a       slam    dunk.
‚ÄîTRACI  DES     JARDINS,        chef,   Jardiniere      (San    Francisco)
Mushrooms        are     delicious       with    wine    as      long    as      the     characteristics         of      the
mushrooms       and     the     wine    are     compatible.     In      general,        I       prefer  chanterelles    with
